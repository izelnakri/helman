make values.yaml integration work on k8s/bases/$chartName work

helm repo add stable
helm repo update
helm template [releaseName] stable/nginx-ingress

- problem with this is no versioning
- no local caching(relies on network & github to fetch the data)
- also avoided helm releases this way(why do I need helm releases?)

mind that k8s secrets stored in base64
