helm upgrade flow for each chart

make $ helman analyze
- always copy the existing values.yaml(with values overwritten)
and remove unused ones on $ helman build


helm repo add stable
helm repo update
helm template [releaseName] stable/nginx-ingress

- problem with this is no versioning
- no local caching(relies on network & github to fetch the data)
- also avoided helm releases this way(why do I need helm releases?)

mind that k8s secrets stored in base64
